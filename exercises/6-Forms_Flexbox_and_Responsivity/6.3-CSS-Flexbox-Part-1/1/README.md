## Exercises

#### 1) Welcome to Flexbox Froggy, a game where you help Froggy and friends by writing CSS code! Guide this frog to the lilypad on the right by using the justify-content property, which aligns items horizontally and accepts the following values:

- flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
- flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
- center: Items align at the center of the container.
- space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
- space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.
- For example, justify-content: flex-end; will move the frog to - right.

#### 2) Use justify-content again to help these frogs get to their lilypads. Remember that this CSS property aligns items horizontally and accepts the following values:

- flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
- flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
- center: Items align at the center of the container.
- space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
- space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.

#### 3) Help all three frogs find their lilypads just by using justify-content. This time, the lilypads have lots of space all around them.

- If you find yourself forgetting the possible values for a property, you can hover over the property name to view them. Try hovering over justify-content.

#### 4) Now the lilypads on the edges have drifted to the shore, increasing the space between them. Use justify-content. This time, the lilypads have equal spacing between them.

#### 5) Now use align-items to help the frogs get to the bottom of the pond. This CSS property aligns items vertically and accepts the following values:

- flex-start: Items align to the top of the container.
- flex-end: Items align to the bottom of the container.
- center: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
- baseline: Items display at the baseline of the container.
- stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.

#### 6) Lead the frog to the center of the pond using a combination of justify-content and align-items.

#### 7) The frogs need to cross the pond again, this time for some lilypads with plenty of space around them. Using a combination of justify-content and align-items.

#### 8) The frogs need to get in the same order as their lilypads using flex-direction. This CSS property defines the direction items are placed in the container, and accepts the following values:

- row: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
- row-reverse: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
- column: Items are placed top to bottom.
- column-reverse: Items are placed bottom to top.

#### 9) Help the frogs find their column of lilypads using flex-direction. This CSS property defines the direction items are placed in the container, and accepts the following values:

- row: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
- row-reverse: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
- column: Items are placed top to bottom.
- column-reverse: Items are placed bottom to top.

#### 10) Help the frogs get to their own lilypads. Although they seem close, it will take both flex-direction and justify-content to get them there.

- Notice that when you set the direction to a reversed row or column, start and end are also reversed.

#### 11) Help the frogs find their lilypads using flex-direction and justify-content.

- Notice that when the flex direction is a column, justify-content changes to the vertical and align-items to the horizontal.

#### 12) Help the frogs find their lilypads using flex-direction and justify-content.

#### 13) Help the frogs find their lilypads using flex-direction, justify-content, and align-items.
